Reference:
    1. Python for Data Analysis
    2. Learning the Pandas Library

Core data structure:
    1. The Series
        the cross between a list and a dictionary

        type(NaN) is float

        Series.iloc[index] ==> query name
        Series.loc[name] ==> query index
            can append or overwrite in place
        
    2. The DataFrame
        two-axis-labeled array (two dimensional)

        !cat [file] in jupyter-notebook ==> cat [file]
        jupyter-notebook can interact with the OS -- more tools to look at

        Querying a DataFrame:
            Boolean masking
                the heart of fast and efficient querying in NumPy
                one, or two dimensional

        Merging datasets:
            Kind of like rational database: inner join, outer join, left join, right join; on 'column(s)'
        
    3. Pandas idoms
        An idionmatic solution ofter has both high performance and high readability. Pandorable.
        Use vectorization, instead of loops, as much as you can!
        
        Method chaining
                Compare A(pandorable) and B(not so pandorable)	       
            A. (df.where(df['SUMLEV']==50])
                .dropna()
                .set_index(['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'], inplace=True)
                .rename(column={'ESTIMATESBASE2010': 'Estimates Base 2010'})
            B. df = df[df['SUMLEV']==50]
            df.set_index(['STNAME','CTYNAME'], inplace=True)
            df.rename(columns={'ESTIMATESBASE2010': 'Estimates Base 2010'})	

        pd.apply()	
        pd.groupby()
        Scales 
            ratio scale 
                units are equally spaced; mathematica operations of +-/* are all valid
            interval scale 
                units are equally spaced, but there is no true zero
            ordinal scale
                the order of the units is important, but not evenly spaced
                e.g. A+, A
            nominal scale 
                categories of data, but the categories have no order with respect to one another
                e.g. teams of a sport

Statistical Basics
	Distribution: Set of all possible random variables
		e.g. flipping coins for heads and tails
			a binomial distribution (two possible outcomes)
			discrete (categories of heads and tails, no real numbers)
 			evenly weighted 
		
		numpy has built-in distribution functions to simulate different situations
		
		Uniform Distribution (continuous)
		Normal (Gausisan) Distribution
			mean, a measure of central tendency
			standard deviation, a measure of variability
		
		Chi Squared Distribution
			skew
			degrees of freedom
		Bimodal Distribution
			Gaussian Mixture Models

		[expected value: different from mean value, is the probability from the underlying distribution.For example, the expected value of rolling a dice is 3.5 (as if we roll the dice infinitly, each of the number occurs in the same probability), while the mean of rolling a dice depends on the sample we have]
		[A book; Think Stats by Allen B. Downey, published by O'Reilly. About probability and statistics for programmers]		

Hypothesis Testing
	Hypothesis: A statment we can test
	    - alternative hypothesis: our idea, e.g. there is a difference between groups
	    - null hypothesis: the alternatie of our idea, e.g. there is no difference between groups

	Critical Value alpha (Î±)
	    - the threshold as to how much chance you are willing to accept
            - typical values in social sciences are 0.1, 0.05, or 0.01
	
	p-hacking
	    - doing many tests untl you find one which is of statistical significance
	    - at a confidence level of 0.05, we expect to find one positive result 1 time out of 20 tests
	    - remedies: 
		Bonferroni correctin; hold-out sets; investigation pre-registration


Course 2 Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

Week 1

Visuallization Wheel Dimensions
    Tools for thinking about design (Alberto Cairo)	
	Abstraction - Figuration
    	    - Boxes and cahrts (abstraction) or real-world physical objects (figurtation)
	Functiionality - Decoration
            - No embellishments (functionality) or artistic embellishments (decoration)
	Density - Lightness
	    - Must be studied in depth (density) or understanable at a glance (lightness)
	Multidenmensional - Unidimensional
	    - Different aspects of phenomena (multidimensional) or single or few items of phenomena (unidimensional)
        Originality - Familiarity
	    - Novel methods of visualization (originality) or established and wel understod methods of visualization (familiarity)
 	Novelty - Redundancy
	     - Explaining each item once (novelty) or encoding multiple explanations of the same phenomena (redundancy)

Graphical Heuristics: DAta-ink Ratio (Edward Tufte)
Book: The Visual Display of Quantitative Information

	What is heuristic?
            - It's a process or rule, not known to be optimal or perfect, that is meant to guide you in decision making. 
	    - Heuristics are meant to be followed untill you have a reason to deviate from them. 
	Data-ink?
	    - the non-erasable core of a graphic. The non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented. 
	    - the data-ink ratio is the amount of data-ink divided by the total ink required to print the graphic. 
	Chartjunk
	    - unintended optical art, e.g. excessive shading or patterning of chart features, which cause visual fatigue.
	    - the grid 
		thining, removing, or desaturating grid lines makes it easier to see the data, instead of being overwhelmed by the number of lines of the page. Direct labeling of data is a great way to reduce this chart junk.
	    - the duck
		non-data creative graphics, whether they be line art of photographs and they're inclusion in the chart.

Graphical heuristics: Lie Factor and Saprk Lines (Edward Tufte)

The Truthful Art (Alberto Cairo)
	A required book for any data scientist.
	Qualities of a great visualization
	    1. Truthful
	 	- Be aware of your actions when cleaning, summarizing and manipulatin gdata and ensure you aren't 1) misleading yourself (self deception), 2) misleading your audience
	    2. Functionality
	    3. Beauty
	    4. Insightfulness
	    5. Enlightening
		- A combination of the previous four, but with a social ethical responsibility
