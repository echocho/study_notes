Reference:
    1. Python for Data Analysis
    2. Learning the Pandas Library

Core data structure:
    1. The Series
        the cross between a list and a dictionary

        type(NaN) is float

        Series.iloc[index] ==> query name
        Series.loc[name] ==> query index
            can append or overwrite in place
        
    2. The DataFrame
        two-axis-labeled array (two dimensional)

        !cat [file] in jupyter-notebook ==> cat [file]
        jupyter-notebook can interact with the OS -- more tools to look at

        Querying a DataFrame:
            Boolean masking
                the heart of fast and efficient querying in NumPy
                one, or two dimensional

        Merging datasets:
            Kind of like rational database: inner join, outer join, left join, right join; on 'column(s)'
        
    3. Pandas idoms
        An idionmatic solution ofter has both high performance and high readability. Pandorable.
        Use vectorization, instead of loops, as much as you can!
        
        Method chaining
                Compare A(pandorable) and B(not so pandorable)	       
            A. (df.where(df['SUMLEV']==50])
                .dropna()
                .set_index(['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'], inplace=True)
                .rename(column={'ESTIMATESBASE2010': 'Estimates Base 2010'})
            B. df = df[df['SUMLEV']==50]
            df.set_index(['STNAME','CTYNAME'], inplace=True)
            df.rename(columns={'ESTIMATESBASE2010': 'Estimates Base 2010'})	

        pd.apply()	
        pd.groupby()
        Scales 
            ratio scale 
                units are equally spaced; mathematica operations of +-/* are all valid
            interval scale 
                units are equally spaced, but there is no true zero
            ordinal scale
                the order of the units is important, but not evenly spaced
                e.g. A+, A
            nominal scale 
                categories of data, but the categories have no order with respect to one another
                e.g. teams of a sport

Statistical Basics
	Distribution: Set of all possible random variables
		e.g. flipping coins for heads and tails
			a binomial distribution (two possible outcomes)
			discrete (categories of heads and tails, no real numbers)
 			evenly weighted 
		
		numpy has built-in distribution functions to simulate different situations
		
		Uniform Distribution (continuous)
		Normal (Gausisan) Distribution
			mean, a measure of central tendency
			standard deviation, a measure of variability
		
		Chi Squared Distribution
			skew
			degrees of freedom
		Bimodal Distribution
			Gaussian Mixture Models

		[expected value: different from mean value, is the probability from the underlying distribution.For example, the expected value of rolling a dice is 3.5 (as if we roll the dice infinitly, each of the number occurs in the same probability), while the mean of rolling a dice depends on the sample we have]

Hypothesis Testing
	Hypothesis: A statment we can test
	    - alternative hypothesis: our idea, e.g. there is a difference between groups
	    - null hypothesis: the alternatie of our idea, e.g. there is no difference between groups

	Critical Value alpha (Î±)
	    - the threshold as to how much chance you are willing to accept
            - typical values in social sciences are 0.1, 0.05, or 0.01
	
	p-hacking
	    - doing many tests untl you find one which is of statistical significance
	    - at a confidence level of 0.05, we expect to find one positive result 1 time out of 20 tests
	    - remedies: 
		Bonferroni correctin; hold-out sets; investigation pre-registration
