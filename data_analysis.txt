Reference:
    1. Python for Data Analysis
    2. Learning the Pandas Library

Core data structure:
    1. The Series
        the cross between a list and a dictionary

        type(NaN) is float

        Series.iloc[index] ==> query name
        Series.loc[name] ==> query index
            can append or overwrite in place
        
    
    2. The DataFrame
        two-axis-labeled array (two dimensional)

        !cat [file] in jupyter-notebook ==> cat [file]
        jupyter-notebook can interact with the OS -- more tools to look at

        Querying a DataFrame:
            Boolean masking
                the heart of fast and efficient querying in NumPy
                one, or two dimensional
